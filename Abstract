Hand_gesture_recognition 
The hand gesture recognition is a process of detecting the hand and its sign in the image.The machine learning algorithms is used to find out
the sign of the hand in the image. This will helpful for the duff people because by using the hand gesture recognition we able to grasp what they are saying.advanced models even able to translate the detected sign into the mp3 format.That is the wonderful application of the Hand gesture recognition.
In the recent time we have seen a lot of development in the AI and Ml, By using those we can develop the HCI(Human computer intercation).
At initial level we able to operate system with keyboard and mouse but as technology increases we give voice commands
we have observed if we show palm our mobile will capture the picture for us that is an application of the hand gesture recognition
