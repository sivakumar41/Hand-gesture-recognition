# Hand-gesture-recognition
Hand gesture recognition is about teaching computers to understand and interpret the movements and gestures we make with our hands. It's like when you wave, point, or make certain shapes with your hands, and the computer can recognize and understand what you're doing. It's used in things like video games, virtual reality, and even in sign language translation. To do this, the computer uses fancy techniques like image processing, machine learning, and deep learning. It looks for hands in images or videos, tracks their movements, and figures out what gestures are being made. It's pretty cool because it lets us interact with computers in a more natural and intuitive way, using our hands instead of keyboards or mice
